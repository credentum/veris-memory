## 🎯 Enhanced Fact Recall Workflow

**Before (Phase 2)**: Query → Intent Classification → Fact Templates → Enhanced Vector Search → Fact-Aware Ranking

**After (Phase 3)**:
```
User Query → Intent Classification → {
    Entity Extraction & Graph Linking
    ↓
    Multi-Strategy Query Expansion:
    • Entity relationship expansion
    • Fact template expansion  
    • Semantic neighbor expansion
    ↓
    Enhanced Vector Search (up to 6 variants)
    ↓
    Hybrid Scoring:
    • Vector similarity (α = 0.4-0.8)
    • Lexical matching (β = 0.2-0.4)
    • Graph signals (γ = 0.0-0.3)
    • Fact pattern boost (0.05-0.15)
    ↓
    Graph-Enhanced Results
