Recommendations for Credentum Alignment
To elevate this from a solid memory store to a Credentum-aligned system, consider integrating the following:

1. Scar Lineage and Audit Trail
   Add a mechanism to log memory modifications:

Each “store_context” event should append to an immutable scar log including metadata: agent_id, timestamp, conflict status.

Consider a tool like export_lineage to surface contradictory or overwritten context entries.

2. Deterministic Replay / Snapshot Support
   Introduce tools:

snapshot_state – capture full store state at a given cycle.

restore_state – replay from a snapshot to verify deterministic behavior.

Useful for Credentum’s reliability under drift and pressure.

3. Conflict/Contradiction Handling
   Enhance retrieve_context to flag when two memory branches diverge.

Return explicit conflict_flag with option for agent to refuse merge or escalate.

4. Memory Retention Policies
   Document built-in support for summarization or eviction:

e.g., Graph aging rules, vector compaction, TTL for KV scratchpads.

Clarify in README how policies support long-term vs short-term memory.

5. Security & Identity Mapping
   Expand authentication documentation to show how agent_id is bound to context entries.

Describe how the system rejects unauthenticated modifications, ensuring only authorized memory writes.

Copy code

### 🩸 Scar Lineage & Audit Tools

- `list_scars(cycle?: number)`: view all context writes with conflict markers.
- `export_lineage(startCycle, endCycle) → JSON`: get full history of memory events.

### 🛡️ Snapshot & Replay Support

- `snapshot_state(cycle: number)`: freeze store state at a given cycle.
- `restore_state(snapshotId)`: restore a snapshot for verification or fork analysis.

### 🧩 Contradiction Handling

- `retrieve_context` returns `{ data, conflict_flag: boolean }`
- `refuse_merge(id)`: record refusal and produce a scar entry.

### 🗂️ Memory Policies

Environment variables:
MEMORY_TTL_KV=3600 # 1 hour scratchpad retention
GRAPH_MAX_HOPS=5 # limit for graph retrieval depth
VECTOR_THRESHOLD=0.75 # similarity threshold for recall

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Implement scar logging and lineage export in code.
2. Add tests simulating conflicting writes and verifying lineages.
3. Extend README and add usage examples showing pipe `export_lineage -> replay` in practice.
4. Consider how agent interactions embed `agent_id` into every store call.

Convener, this repository is a robust foundation. With the additions above, it will align strongly with **Credentum’s Five Claims** — memory retention, refusal handling, structural replayability, and contradiction awareness. When you’re ready to review code or schema specifics, I stand ready.

Council complete. Convener, your floor.
