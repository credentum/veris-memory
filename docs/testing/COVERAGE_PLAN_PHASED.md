# Phased Coverage Improvement Plan - From 25% to 80%

## Current Status (Baseline)
- **Current Coverage**: ~25% (verified working measurement)
- **Test Infrastructure**: Fixed and consistent 
- **Tests Available**: 4000+ tests across all modules
- **Command to Use**: `make coverage` (2-3 minutes, ~25% result)

## Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Target: 25% → 35% (+10%)**

### Priority Files (Currently 0% coverage):
1. **src/core/base_component.py** - Foundation class for all components
   - Test initialization, context management, logging
   - Expected gain: +2%

2. **src/core/config.py** - Configuration loading and validation  
   - Test file loading, validation, deep merge functionality
   - Expected gain: +2%

3. **src/core/monitoring.py** - Metrics and observability
   - Test metrics collection, health checks, monitoring decorators
   - Expected gain: +3%

4. **src/core/utils.py** - Utility functions
   - Test helper functions, data transformations
   - Expected gain: +2%

5. **src/core/rate_limiter.py** - Rate limiting logic
   - Test token bucket, concurrent access patterns
   - Expected gain: +1%

### Implementation Strategy:
- Focus on public APIs and main code paths
- Use existing test patterns from working tests
- Add tests to existing test files where possible
- Aim for 80% line coverage per new module

## Phase 2: Storage & Data Layer (Week 2)
**Target: 35% → 50% (+15%)**

### Priority Areas:
1. **src/storage/** modules with low coverage
   - Neo4j client operations
   - Qdrant vector operations  
   - Redis caching layer
   - Expected gain: +6%

2. **src/core/embedding_service.py** - Vector embedding generation
   - Test embedding creation, batching, caching
   - Expected gain: +4%

3. **src/core/query_validator.py** - Query validation and sanitization
   - Test SQL injection prevention, parameter validation
   - Expected gain: +3%

4. **Expand existing storage tests**
   - Add edge cases to current test files
   - Test error recovery and timeout scenarios
   - Expected gain: +2%

## Phase 3: API & Security (Week 3)
**Target: 50% → 65% (+15%)**

### Priority Areas:
1. **src/mcp_server/** - API server components (currently minimal coverage)
   - Server initialization and routing
   - Request/response handling
   - Middleware and validation
   - Expected gain: +6%

2. **src/security/** - Security infrastructure
   - RBAC middleware and permissions
   - Security scanning and validation
   - Auth token handling
   - Expected gain: +5%

3. **src/auth/** - Authentication components
   - Login flows, session management
   - Token generation and validation
   - Expected gain: +4%

## Phase 4: Integration & Complete Workflows (Week 4)
**Target: 65% → 75% (+10%)**

### Focus Areas:
1. **End-to-end API workflows**
   - Complete request lifecycle testing
   - Multi-component integration tests
   - Error propagation and recovery
   - Expected gain: +4%

2. **Cross-component interactions**
   - Storage + API integration
   - Security + API integration  
   - Monitoring + all components
   - Expected gain: +3%

3. **Performance and load testing**
   - Benchmark critical paths
   - Stress testing under load
   - Expected gain: +2%

4. **Enhanced error handling coverage**
   - Exception paths and edge cases
   - Resource cleanup scenarios
   - Expected gain: +1%

## Phase 5: Polish & Edge Cases (Week 5)
**Target: 75% → 80% (+5%)**

### Final Improvements:
1. **Complete error path coverage**
   - All exception handlers
   - Timeout and retry logic
   - Resource exhaustion scenarios
   - Expected gain: +2%

2. **Boundary condition testing**
   - Empty inputs, null values
   - Maximum/minimum limits
   - Invalid data formats
   - Expected gain: +2%

3. **Documentation and examples**
   - Doctest examples where appropriate
   - Test fixtures and helpers
   - Expected gain: +1%

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Writing Standards:
- **Naming**: `test_<module>_<function>_<scenario>`
- **Structure**: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies (Redis, Neo4j, APIs)
- **Coverage Target**: 80% line coverage per new module

### Testing Tools Already Available:
- pytest with parallel execution support
- pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- pytest-mock for mocking
- Existing test fixtures and patterns

### Quality Gates:
- **Week 1**: 35% coverage minimum
- **Week 2**: 50% coverage minimum  
- **Week 3**: 65% coverage minimum
- **Week 4**: 75% coverage minimum
- **Week 5**: 80% coverage target

### Monitoring Progress:
```bash
# Check current coverage
make coverage

# Quick subset coverage during development
make test-subset

# Track progress over time
make coverage-track  # Saves snapshots
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Flaky tests**: Use proper mocking and test isolation
- **Slow tests**: Keep unit tests under 100ms each
- **Complex dependencies**: Mock external services completely

### Process Risks:
- **Coverage inflation**: Focus on meaningful tests, not just line coverage
- **Test maintenance**: Follow existing patterns and conventions
- **Resource constraints**: Prioritize high-impact modules first

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative:
- Coverage percentage increase (tracked weekly)
- Test execution time (should remain under 5 minutes)
- Test reliability (>95% pass rate)

### Qualitative:
- Code confidence when making changes
- Faster debugging with comprehensive test coverage
- Easier onboarding with documented test examples

## Quick Start for Contributors

```bash
# 1. Check current status
make coverage

# 2. Pick a module from Phase 1 list
# 3. Look at existing test patterns:
grep -r "class Test" tests/core/

# 4. Add tests following existing patterns
# 5. Verify coverage increase:
make test-subset

# 6. Submit PR with coverage metrics
```

## Expected Timeline

- **Week 1**: Foundation modules (25% → 35%)
- **Week 2**: Storage layer (35% → 50%) 
- **Week 3**: API & Security (50% → 65%)
- **Week 4**: Integration (65% → 75%)
- **Week 5**: Polish (75% → 80%)

**Total Duration**: 5 weeks to reach 80% coverage target
**Current Working Command**: `make coverage` (reliable ~25% result)
