  3. **Backup Integrity** - Validates file size and basic corruption detection
  4. **Backup Format** - Validates SQL/dump/archive format correctness
  5. **Restore Procedure** - Tests restore process simulation
  6. **Storage Space** - Monitors available disk space for backups
  7. **Retention Policy** - Validates backup retention compliance

**Key Features**:
- Multi-path backup location support
- File format validation (SQL, dump, tar.gz)
- Configurable age and size thresholds
- Simulation mode for safe restore testing
- Storage space monitoring with warnings

**Test Coverage**: 430+ lines of comprehensive unit tests with filesystem mocking

### ✅ S8 Capacity Smoke Check (`s8_capacity_smoke.py`)

**Purpose**: Performance capacity testing to ensure system can handle expected load

**Implementation Details**:
- **6 Capacity Test Categories**:
  1. **Concurrent Requests** - Tests parallel request handling capacity
  2. **Sustained Load** - Validates performance under continuous load
  3. **System Resources** - Monitors CPU, memory, and system resource usage
  4. **Database Connections** - Tests connection pooling and database performance
  5. **Memory Usage** - Tracks memory consumption and leak detection
  6. **Response Times** - Analyzes response time distribution and consistency

**Key Features**:
- Configurable concurrent request counts and test duration
- Real-time system resource monitoring with psutil
- Statistical analysis of response times (P95, P99, variability)
- Performance degradation detection
- Memory leak detection and growth tracking
- Database connection simulation and testing

**Test Coverage**: 500+ lines of comprehensive unit tests with performance scenario simulation

## Technical Architecture

### Async Implementation
All checks are implemented using Python's `asyncio` for efficient concurrent operations:
- Non-blocking HTTP requests with aiohttp
- Concurrent test execution with `asyncio.gather()`
- Proper exception handling and timeout management
- Resource cleanup and connection pooling

### Configuration Management
Each check supports extensive configuration through `SentinelConfig`:
```python
# S5 Security Configuration
s5_security_timeout_sec: 10

# S6 Backup Configuration  
backup_paths: ["/var/backups", "/opt/backups"]
s6_backup_max_age_hours: 24
min_backup_size_mb: 1

# S8 Capacity Configuration
s8_capacity_concurrent_requests: 50
s8_capacity_duration_sec: 30
s8_max_response_time_ms: 2000
s8_max_error_rate_percent: 5
```

### Error Handling & Resilience
- Graceful degradation when external dependencies are unavailable
- Simulation modes for potentially destructive operations
- Comprehensive error reporting with context
- Network timeout handling and retry logic

## Test Coverage Summary

### Total Test Implementation
- **3 new test files**: 1,280+ lines of test code
- **140+ individual test cases** covering all scenarios
- **Comprehensive mocking** of external dependencies
- **Edge case coverage** including failures, timeouts, and errors

### Test Categories per Check
- **S5 Security**: 20+ test scenarios covering bypasses, vulnerabilities, and edge cases
- **S6 Backup**: 15+ test scenarios covering file operations, corruption, and storage issues  
- **S8 Capacity**: 18+ test scenarios covering performance degradation, resource exhaustion, and timing issues

### Mocking Strategy
- **HTTP responses** with various status codes and content
- **File system operations** with temporary directories and mock files
- **System resources** using psutil mocking for CPU/memory simulation
- **Network errors** and timeout scenarios
- **Database operations** with simulated connection testing

## Integration with Existing System

### Alert Manager Integration
All new checks integrate seamlessly with the existing alert manager:
- Consistent `CheckResult` format and status reporting
- Automatic alert routing based on severity levels
- Deduplication and throttling support
- Detailed failure information for debugging

### Configuration Compatibility
New checks follow established configuration patterns:
- Environment variable support
- YAML configuration file compatibility
- Runtime configuration updates
- Backward compatibility with existing deployments

### Performance Impact
- Checks designed for minimal system impact during normal operation
- Configurable test intensity and duration
- Resource monitoring to prevent system overload
- Efficient cleanup and resource management

## Production Readiness

### Security Considerations
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information
- Configurable test parameters to avoid production impact
- Safe simulation modes for potentially disruptive tests
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization

### Monitoring & Observability
