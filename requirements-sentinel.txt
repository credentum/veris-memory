# ===================================================================
# OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES - Prometheus Integration
# ===================================================================
# NOTE: prometheus-client is NOT required for sentinel operation!
#
# Sentinel includes Prometheus integration checks (S4-metrics-wiring) that
# run in "simulation mode" when Prometheus is not available. The checks will
# gracefully handle missing Prometheus endpoints and report on available
# metrics endpoints only.
#
# Only install prometheus-client if you want to:
# 1. Export sentinel's own metrics to Prometheus
# 2. Integrate with an existing Prometheus deployment
# 3. Use Grafana dashboards that pull from Prometheus
#
# Without it, sentinel still monitors:
# - Service health endpoints
# - Application metrics from /metrics endpoints
# - All other S1-S11 checks
#
# Uncomment the line below to enable Prometheus support:
# prometheus-client==0.19.0
