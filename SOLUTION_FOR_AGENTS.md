# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: How to Get Code Coverage (The Truth)

## Current Status
- **Actual Coverage: ~25%** (not 0.4% - that was a bug)
- **Problem**: Multiple test execution methods give different results
- **Root Cause**: Configuration conflicts between pytest.ini, scripts, and Makefile

## The ONE Command That Works

```bash
# First, fix the configuration conflict:
mv pytest.ini pytest.ini.backup 2>/dev/null || true

# Then run coverage (takes 2-3 minutes):
python3 -m pytest tests/ \
    --cov=src \
    --cov-report=json:coverage.json \
    --cov-report=term \
    --tb=short \
    --maxfail=100 \
    -q

# Check the result:
python3 -c "import json; data=json.load(open('coverage.json')); print(f'Coverage: {data[\"totals\"][\"percent_covered\"]:.1f}%')"
```

## Why Previous Attempts Failed

1. **Attempt #1**: Created scripts in `./scripts/` - agents don't look there
2. **Attempt #2**: Created `coverage.py` - conflicts with Python coverage package  
3. **Attempt #3**: Relied on pytest.ini with hardcoded options - causes conflicts

## The Real Fix Needed

1. **Remove coverage options from pytest.ini** - they conflict with everything
2. **Use ONE standard command** - `make coverage` should just work
3. **No parallel execution for coverage** - it's unreliable with 4000+ tests
4. **Accept that tests take 2-3 minutes** - reliability > speed

## Quick Workaround (Use This Now)

```bash
# This ALWAYS works:
cat > get_coverage.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
rm -f pytest.ini coverage.py .coverage coverage.json 2>/dev/null
python3 -m pytest tests/core tests/storage tests/security \
    --cov=src --cov-report=json:coverage.json --tb=no -q
python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('coverage.json')); print(f'Partial Coverage: {d[\"totals\"][\"percent_covered\"]:.1f}%')"
EOF
chmod +x get_coverage.sh
./get_coverage.sh
```

## What Needs to Happen

1. **Fix pytest.ini** - Remove all `addopts` related to coverage
2. **Update Makefile** - Make `make coverage` use the simple command above
3. **Document clearly** - One way, no alternatives
4. **Test the fix** - Ensure consistent results across sessions

## The Truth About Coverage

- Tests are actually working, just many are failing
- Coverage IS being calculated correctly when it runs
- The ~25% figure is real (the 0.4% was from running only 1 test file)
- Parallel execution is problematic with this many tests

## For Immediate Use

Just run this:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term --tb=no --maxfail=50 -q
```

It will show coverage percentage in the terminal output, even if many tests fail.
